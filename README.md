# Enhancing Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis with Image Classification from EUS-FNA

## Overview

Accurate and early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer remains highly challenging due to its typically late presentation and ambiguous morphological features. This project explores a novel computational pipeline designed for pancreatic cancer diagnosis using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) imaging, powered by machine learning techniques.

## Motivation

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, largely due to its diagnostic difficulties. Existing conventional models:

- Often struggle to capture complex morphological cues.
- Lack probabilistic reasoning.
- Fail to generalize across heterogeneous clinical settings.

There is a critical need to create diagnostic systems that support expert-level performance while meeting clinical interpretability requirements.

## Contributions

This project proposes a systematic approach with the following characteristics:

- **Structured Probabilistic Modeling**: Captures the uncertainty and interdependence in clinical diagnosis.
- **Multi-modal Feature Learning**: Integrates diverse data types for comprehensive understanding.
- **Adaptive Clinical Reasoning**: Aligns model behavior with real-world diagnostic logic.

## Highlights

- Tailored for EUS-FNA image-based diagnosis.
- Harmonized with principles of multi-modal oncology informatics.
- Emphasizes interpretability and generalizability.
- Addresses real-world clinical challenges, including data heterogeneity and ambiguity.

## Keywords

Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis, EUS-FNA, Symbolic Inference, Multi-modal Learning, Diagnostic Trajectory Modeling

## Future Work

- Expand model evaluation on larger and more diverse cohorts.
- Investigate integration with electronic health records (EHR).
- Explore real-time inference applications in clinical workflows.
